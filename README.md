# PaciSense
PaciSense is a pH-monitoring pacifier that tracks oral acidity to detect early childhood caries (ECC) risk. By continuously measuring saliva pH and alerting parents when prolonged acidity occurs, PaciSense enables early intervention, promoting better oral health and reducing the need for invasive dental treatments in young children.
